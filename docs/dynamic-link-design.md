# Dynamic Link — Design Document

**Status:** Draft, pre-implementation. Sibling of the wfb-ng
project; companion to
[fec-enhancements-v2.md](fec-enhancements-v2.md).
**Scope:** Design only. No source files are modified by this document.

**Project name:** **dynamic-link**. Binary
names use the `dl-` prefix (`dl-applier`, `dl-inject`); the Python
package is `dynamic_link`; the config directory is
`/etc/dynamic-link/`.

**Repository layout.** Dynamic-link is a **separate repo** from
wfb-ng. It consumes two stable public surfaces that wfb-ng
already exposes on branch `feat/interleaving_uep`, and ships
its own two components:

- **GS controller — Python service.** Connects to wfb-ng's
  existing JSON stats API (`stats_port`, e.g. 8103) for
  link-health signals; runs the state machine; decides
  `(k, n, depth)` plus encoder / radio knobs; ships commands
  to the drone over the existing `tunnel` return link. No
  wfb-ng source changes required — the stats API and the
  return-link transport are both pre-existing wfb-ng surfaces.
- **Drone applier — C binary.** Listens on a local UDP port for
  decision packets from the GS, validates each against a local
  safety ceiling, and dispatches: FEC/depth via wfb-ng's
  `wfb_tx` control socket (wire format: vendored `tx_cmd.h`),
  radio via `iw`, encoder via a per-encoder helper. The drone
  runs no Python and no wfb-ng Python service — the applier
  plus `wfb_tx` / `wfb_rx` / `wfb_tun` is the entire
  dynamic-link footprint there.

**Integration contracts with wfb-ng** (all pre-existing, no
upstream changes required to start):

- *GS side*: wfb-ng's JSON stats API on `stats_port` — same
  feed wfb-cli consumes. PKT/SESSION/RX_ANT records with the
  schema §3 documents, contract version `2`.
- *Drone side*: wfb-ng's `wfb_tx` control UDP socket, speaking
  the `tx_cmd.h` wire format. Dynamic-link vendors a copy of
  `tx_cmd.h` at a known wfb-ng commit; a startup check
  compares the vendored `WFB_IPC_CONTRACT_VERSION` against
  what the running `wfb_tx` advertises.
- *Both sides*: wfb-ng's `tunnel` and `mavlink` stream
  endpoints for the return-link transport.

Dynamic-link does not modify wfb-ng. It's a pure consumer of
already-stabilised interfaces.

## 1. Scope

### In scope

**GS controller (Python, standalone service):**

- Subscribes to wfb-ng's JSON stats API (§3) for link-health
  signals.
- Runs a control loop against a state machine with hysteresis.
- Enforces a latency budget and refuses decisions that would
  exceed it.
- Ships decision packets over the existing return link
  (`tunnel` stream) to the drone applier.
- Runs against fec-enhancements Phase 1's single video stream.

**Drone applier (C, standalone binary):**

- Listens on a local UDP socket for decision packets arriving
  through the return-link `tunnel`.
- Validates each decision against per-airframe limits from a
  local config file (the safety ceiling).
- Applies accepted decisions:
  - FEC / depth via the local `wfb_tx` control UDP socket
    (wire format: vendored `tx_cmd.h`).
  - Radio parameters via `iw` / `CMD_SET_RADIO`.
  - Encoder parameters via a platform-specific helper
    (subprocess or RPC; see §2 backends).
- Enforces the four failsafes of §5 independently of the GS.

**Shared:**

- Configuration surface for per-airframe tuning (§6):
  `/etc/dynamic-link/gs.yaml` on the GS;
  `/etc/dynamic-link/drone.conf` on the drone.
- A clear failure model (§5, §9).

### Out of scope

- Changes to wfb-ng. Everything dynamic-link needs from wfb-ng
  is specified in
  [fec-enhancements-v2.md Phase 3](fec-enhancements-v2.md#phase-3--control-plane-api-for-an-external-adaptive-link-process)
  and landed on `feat/interleaving_uep` via Phase 1 Steps A
  and C (the IPC contract is stable, the control commands are
  implemented, the JSON stats API already serves wfb-cli).
  Dynamic-link is a pure consumer.
- The FEC / interleaver implementations themselves (they live
  in wfb-ng).
- Flight-controller integration (MAVLink RTH triggers, etc.) —
  we expose a `budget_exhausted` signal but the flight stack
  decides what to do with it.

### What the controller actually decides, concretely

The GS controller picks values for these knobs; the drone applier
(for items that live on the drone) validates and applies. Two
control loops own the knobs (see §4):

| # | Knob                               | Loop (§4) | Primary signal        | Applied by                       |
|---|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | Radio `mcs_index`                  | Leading   | `rssi` / `snr`        | drone applier → `wfb_tx` ctrl    |
| 2 | Radio `bandwidth`                  | Leading   | `rssi` / `snr`        | drone applier → `wfb_tx` ctrl    |
| 3 | TX power                           | Leading (inner) | `rssi` gap from `rssi_target` | drone applier → `iw` helper |
| 4 | Encoder bitrate                    | Leading   | coupled to MCS row    | drone applier → encoder helper   |
| 5 | Encoder fps                        | Leading   | coupled to MCS row (last-resort) | drone applier → encoder helper |
| 6 | Encoder ROI (foveated)             | Leading   | last-resort row only  | drone applier → encoder helper   |
| 7 | `(k, n)` for the video stream      | Trailing  | `k` per MCS row (§4.1 table / §6.1 profile); `n` escalates on `residual_loss`, `fec_work` | drone applier → `wfb_tx` ctrl |
| 8 | Interleaver depth for the video stream | Trailing | `burst_rate`, `holdoff_rate` | drone applier → `wfb_tx` ctrl |
| 9 | Encoder GOP length                 | Both      | transition into protective | drone applier → encoder helper |
|10 | "Emit IDR now" one-shot            | Trailing  | any escalation        | drone applier → encoder helper   |

`short_gi` is deliberately **not** a controlled knob in this
design. The long guard interval (`short_gi = false`, 800 ns) is
more robust against delay spread at flying altitudes and
distances; the ~11 % throughput we give up by avoiding short GI
is a cheap trade for removing one source of PHY-level
instability. `short_gi` is pinned to `false` at the TX and never
changed. Revisit if operator feedback says otherwise.

All knobs are decided on the GS, shipped over the return link as
decision packets, and executed on the drone. The GS's own
`wfb_tx` (return-link FEC) is out of scope — this design leaves
the return link at its static master.cfg defaults.

```

Dynamic-link sits next to wfb-ng on both hosts. It reads what
wfb-ng already publishes (stats JSON on GS, tunnel/mavlink
streams on both sides) and writes through what wfb-ng already
listens on (`wfb_tx` control socket on drone, tunnel endpoint
for return path). No wfb-ng source changes.

### Why the asymmetry (Python GS / C drone)

- **GS is resource-rich.** A full laptop or SBC running wfb-ng's
  Twisted service, GStreamer decoding, and the OSD renderer.
  Python fits in naturally and reuses wfb-ng's parser / stats /
  control-socket plumbing. The policy engine is second-scale,
  hysteresis-driven — no real-time constraint.
- **Drone is resource-tight.** Typical targets (Radxa Zero 3W,
  OpenIPC SoCs) boot a minimal image without Python. The drone
  applier's job is small: parse decisions, check bounds, issue
  `tx_cmd.h` packets to the local `wfb_tx`. C keeps the runtime
  footprint ~100 KB and avoids adding Python to the drone image.
- **Safety-critical path stays local.** The drone applier
  independently enforces the per-airframe ceiling (§5 failsafe 4)
  and the GS-link watchdog (§5 failsafe 1). A compromised or
  crashing GS cannot push the drone outside its envelope — the
  enforcement is in the drone's own process, in a language with
  no runtime to crash.

### Backends on the drone

Each backend is platform-specific; the C applier uses a tiny
dispatch table with a uniform interface:

```
struct wla_backend {
    const char *name;
    int  (*apply)(const struct wla_command *cmd);
    int  (*probe)(void);      // returns 0 if supported on this platform
};
```

- **Radio backend.** 8812au vs 8812eu vs ath9k_htc vs rtl88x2bu.
  Implementation: the applier either calls `iw` via
  `posix_spawn` (simple; no libnl dep) or links libnl directly on
  platforms where the overhead matters.
- **Encoder backend.** GStreamer pipeline vs. custom ffmpeg
  pipeline vs. v4l2 direct vs. vendor RPC (Rockchip MPP,
  Allwinner CedarX, etc.). The backend exposes `set_bitrate`,
  `set_gop`, `set_fps`, `set_roi`, `request_idr`. Because encoder
  control paths vary widely by platform, the applier typically
  talks to a separate per-platform encoder helper over a local
  Unix socket — keeping the applier itself small and
  platform-agnostic.
- **OS backend.** Optional. CPU governor pinning or sysctl tweaks.

Unsupported operations return `WLA_ENOTSUP` so the policy engine
on the GS, informed via the MAVLink status channel (§10), can
degrade gracefully.

### Process topology

- **GS (Python, standalone service).** One dynamic-link GS
  service per wfb-ng instance on the GS host. Runs as a
  separate process (own systemd unit), subscribing to wfb-ng's
  JSON stats API. Primary controller lives here: it has the
  freshest view of RX stats because wfb-ng's `wfb_rx` on the
  GS is the authoritative source.
- **Drone (C, standalone binary `dl-applier`).** Spawned by the
  drone's init system alongside `wfb_tx`. Pure executor:
  receives decisions, validates, dispatches. Holds no policy
  state of its own beyond the ceiling check and the watchdog
  timer.
- **Return link.** Asymmetric by design (§10):
  - *GS → drone (decision path).* Raw UDP, fixed-size struct,
    explicit endianness, carried over the existing `tunnel`
    stream protocol profile at
    [wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg:282](../../wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg#L282).
    Keeps the drone-side C parser trivially small (one struct,
    no library deps).
  - *Drone → GS (status path).* MAVLink messages over the
    existing `mavlink` stream
    ([master.cfg:261](../../wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg#L261)):
    `STATUSTEXT` for human-readable events, a lightweight
    custom message for structured rejections. Co-locates with
    the flight-controller telemetry the operator already
    reads.

  Both streams are wired into `[drone]` and `[gs]` at
  [master.cfg:132-154](../../wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg#L132-L154).

- **Drone-local OSD sink.** The applier also writes a compact
  text line describing the current dynamic-link state to
  `/tmp/MSPOSD.msg` (default path), which
  [OpenIPC/msposd](https://github.com/OpenIPC/msposd) picks up
  as a custom OSD message and overlays on the outgoing video
  before encoding. No MAVLink dependency — msposd's custom
  message feature is a simple file-drop interface. See §6 drone
  config for the update rate and format knobs, §4B for the line
  format. This is the lowest-friction way to let the pilot see
  the controller's decisions in real time through the same
  video feed they're flying on; no GS OSD plumbing needed on
  top of wfb-ng's existing renderer.

---

## 3. Signals

(All signal consumption is GS-side. The drone applier takes
already-decided commands over the return link; it does not parse
any stats itself.)

### Signal classification

Two primary signals drive the controller, playing different roles:

- **RSSI / SNR (from `RX_ANT`)** — *leading, feed-forward*. The
  physical-layer signal moves before packet loss appears: when
  the link fades, SNR drops seconds before the PER exceeds the
  FEC budget. Drives MCS, TX power, and encoder bitrate — i.e.
  the knobs that set the *link margin*. The goal is to keep RSSI
  well above the MCS sensitivity floor so loss never starts.
- **residual_loss (from `PKT`)** — *trailing, safety-critical*.
  Counts primaries the consumer never saw. In FPV one lost block
  is a visible video glitch; glitches are unacceptable. The rule
  isn't "watch residual_loss trend," it's "any residual_loss > 0
  for even one 100 ms window triggers an immediate protective
  escalation." The feed-forward loop is supposed to prevent this
  from ever firing; when it does fire, the feed-forward loop was
  too slow or had bad calibration.

Everything else (`fec_work_rate`, `burst_rate`, `holdoff_rate`,
`late_rate`) is secondary — useful for picking *which* knob to
turn within an escalation, not for deciding *whether* to escalate.

FPV-specific doctrine: **prefer blocky or slower video over
glitchy video.** That means dropping encoder bitrate, coarsening
MCS, or reducing fps is always preferable to letting
residual_loss become non-zero. The policy engine in §4 enforces
that ordering explicitly.

### Primary source — stdout `IPC_MSG` from `wfb_rx`

Per the contract stabilised in
[fec-enhancements-v2.md Phase 3 §2.1](fec-enhancements-v2.md#21-stable-ipc_msg-contract-rewritten-from-v1)
and landed in Phase 1 Step A, lines on stdout at `log_interval`
cadence (stock default 1000 ms; this design sets it to **100 ms**
— see the "Derived metrics" section below):

```
<ts> \t RX_ANT  \t <freq:mcs:bw> \t <ant_id> \t <count>:<rssi_min>:<rssi_avg>:<rssi_max>:<snr_min>:<snr_avg>:<snr_max>
<ts> \t PKT     \t <all>:<all_bytes>:<dec_err>:<session>:<data>:<uniq>:<fec_recovered>:<lost>:<bad>:<outgoing>:<outgoing_bytes>:<bursts_recovered>:<holdoff_fired>:<late_after_deadline>
<ts> \t SESSION \t <epoch>:<fec_type>:<k>:<n>:<interleave_depth>:<contract_version>
```

Fields #12–#14 of `PKT` (Phase 1 Step D) document RX-side
deadline-state-machine activity. Fields #5–#6 of `SESSION`
(Phase 1 Step A): `interleave_depth` tells the daemon the
currently-advertised depth without a round-trip to `wfb_tx_cmd`,
and `contract_version` identifies this schema as v2 (bumps if
fields are reordered or reinterpreted; plan §2.1 stability
commitment).

`SESSION` is now emitted **every `log_interval`** in addition to
on-change (Phase 1 Step A "B2 bootstrap"), so a mid-stream restart
of the daemon sees the current `(k, n, depth)` on the next tick
without waiting for a 1C refresh. Caveat: the periodic emit is
gated on `session_established` ([src/rx.cpp:572](../../src/rx.cpp#L572)),
so cold start waits up to one `SESSION_KEY_ANNOUNCE_MSEC` (1 s)
before the first `SESSION` line arrives.

**How the GS controller consumes these lines.** Wfb-ng already
spawns `wfb_rx` from
[wfb_ng/services.py:174](../../wfb_ng/services.py#L174) (and
three other sites) and parses `PKT` / `SESSION` / `RX_ANT` at
[wfb_ng/protocols.py:392-449](../../wfb_ng/protocols.py#L392-L449).
wfb-ng then re-exposes those parsed records on its **JSON stats
API** — the same feed wfb-cli consumes — at `stats_port`
(default 8003 on drone, 8103 on GS; see
[wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg:138](../../wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg#L138)).

Dynamic-link's GS service connects to that JSON API as an
ordinary TCP client, reads line-delimited records at 10 Hz
(`log_interval = 100` in wfb-ng's `[common]` block; see the
next subsection), and deserialises each record into the same
fields §3 documents. No second `wfb_rx` spawn, no stdout-
scraping, no in-process Python coupling to wfb-ng.

The drone applier never runs this path — it does not parse
IPC_MSG, spawn `wfb_rx`, or talk to the stats API; all of §3
describes GS-side behaviour only.

### Derived metrics per 100 ms window (10 Hz)

FPV drones move fast (≥ 20 m/s in sport modes, higher in freestyle);
obstacle transitions and antenna-orientation changes can move the
RSSI operating point several dB in under 300 ms. A 1 s metric
window is too slow to react. The GS controller samples at **10 Hz**
(100 ms per window).

To get 10 Hz counters out of `wfb_rx`, set `log_interval = 100` in
the `[common]` section of
[wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg:26](../../wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg#L26).
This is a wfb-ng-wide setting — all consumers (wfb-cli, tuntap
keepalive, the dynamic-link GS service) will see the faster cadence.
`wfb_rx` / `wfb_tx` `dump_stats()` at the new cadence is cheap; the
practical cost is that `wfb-cli` tables animate 10x faster (display
concern only, no correctness impact — wfb-cli divides byte counts
by `log_interval` to derive rates, so its numbers stay right).

#### Per-window raw counters

Each 100 ms PKT line yields:

```
residual_loss_w  = count_p_lost / (count_p_outgoing + count_p_lost)
fec_work_rate_w  = count_p_fec_recovered / (count_p_outgoing + count_p_lost)
packet_rate_w    = count_p_data / 0.1          # fragments/sec

burst_rate_w     = count_bursts_recovered / 0.1     # events/sec
holdoff_rate_w   = count_holdoff_fired / 0.1
late_rate_w      = count_late_after_deadline / 0.1
```

Each 100 ms RX_ANT line (one per antenna key) yields radio-layer
samples. Reduce across antennas to a single channel estimate:

```
# Per window, taken across all RX_ANT lines in the window:
rssi_min_w   = min_{ant} rssi_min       # worst-case across antennas
rssi_avg_w   = avg_{ant} rssi_avg       # diversity-combined estimate
snr_min_w    = min_{ant} snr_min
snr_avg_w    = avg_{ant} snr_avg
```

`rssi_min_w` is the operational driver — the RSSI the weakest
antenna saw in the window is the margin-limiting number. On
diversity setups a per-antenna failure (obstructed, disconnected)
must not hide the fact that the surviving antenna is being
operated near its sensitivity floor.

At 8 Mbps video on MCS7 40 MHz HT
(`inter_packet_interval ≈ 1.4 ms`, per fec-enhancements-v2.md §4.2),
a healthy link sees **~70 primaries per 100 ms window** and
**~100 data fragments** (primaries + parity at `(k=8, n=12)`).
That's enough packets to spot a state change, but few enough that
single-window outliers matter — a single lost fragment in a window
with 70 primaries reads `residual_loss_w ≈ 0.014`, which would
cross the DEGRADE threshold on its own.

#### EWMA-smoothed controller inputs

Raw per-window values are jittery; smooth via EWMA before the
policy engine consumes them. Smoothing varies by role:

```
# Leading feed-forward signal — want fast reaction, but not
# every fading spike. Half-second time constant.
rssi            = ewma(rssi_min_w,        α = 0.2)   # ≈ 500 ms
snr             = ewma(snr_min_w,         α = 0.2)

# Trailing protective signal — intentionally *not* EWMA-smoothed.
# In FPV, a single-window block loss is already a video glitch;
# reacting on the raw per-window value is the correct behaviour.
residual_loss   = residual_loss_w                   # no smoothing

# Headroom + pattern signals — infrequent events, slower EWMA.
fec_work        = ewma(fec_work_rate_w,   α = 0.2)   # ≈ 500 ms
burst_rate      = ewma(burst_rate_w,      α = 0.1)   # ≈ 1 s
holdoff_rate    = ewma(holdoff_rate_w,    α = 0.1)
late_rate       = ewma(late_rate_w,       α = 0.1)
```

Rationale:

- **`rssi` / `snr`** drive the leading feed-forward loop (§4).
  Half-second smoothing damps single-window fades without masking
  sustained attenuation — perfect for setting MCS and encoder
  bitrate in anticipation of channel changes.
- **`residual_loss`** is *not* smoothed. One lost block in a
  100 ms window is a glitch the pilot will see; the protective
  response must fire on the raw value. Smoothing would delay the
  reaction and amortise multiple glitches into an averaged number
  — exactly the wrong optimisation in FPV.
- **`fec_work` / `burst_rate` / `holdoff_rate` / `late_rate`**
  feed the FEC knob selector within an escalation; clumped-loss
  events are infrequent per-window (often zero), so a slower
  EWMA reduces noise without losing much responsiveness.

**Why this shape for `residual_loss`.** The intuitive-looking
`1 - (lost + fec_recovered) / data` penalises successful FEC
recovery (e.g. 10 % fragment loss fully absorbed by FEC reads
0.89, not 1.0), which makes any state-machine threshold above
0.9 effectively unreachable whenever FEC is doing work.
`residual_loss` is the fraction of primaries the consumer never
saw — unaffected by how much the codec worked behind the scenes.
`fec_work_rate` is tracked separately as an orthogonal signal:
rising `fec_work_rate` means the parity headroom is being
consumed, a cue to raise `n` *before* FEC starts missing.

Both use `count_p_outgoing + count_p_lost` as the denominator —
the estimate of how many primaries the TX actually emitted in
this window. `count_p_data` (used for the `packet_rate` sanity
check) counts every decrypted fragment including parity, so it
is `~n/k` times larger than `count_p_outgoing` and not a useful
loss-fraction denominator.

**Leading feed-forward loop (RSSI-driven):**

- `rssi` / `snr` → drives **MCS**, **TX power**, and **encoder
  bitrate**. RSSI maps through a per-airframe table (§6) to a
  target operating point; the controller steers MCS + bitrate
  together (outer loop) while TX power tracks an RSSI target
  (inner loop) so the link margin stays ≥ `rssi_margin_db`
  above the MCS sensitivity floor. Guard interval is pinned to
  long (`short_gi = false`) for robustness.

**Trailing protective loop (loss-driven):**

- `residual_loss > 0` in any window → **immediate escalation**:
  raise FEC `n` one step, fire IDR. No hysteresis, no wait — the
  pilot already saw the glitch. This is the safety net for when
  the feed-forward loop was wrong or late.
- `residual_loss > 0` sustained across multiple windows → in
  addition to the above, step the feed-forward loop down one
  gear (lower MCS / lower bitrate) as well. The leading loop is
  clearly mis-calibrated and the RSSI thresholds need to be
  tighter.
- `fec_work` rising while `residual_loss == 0` → parity headroom
  is being consumed but not yet exhausted. Raise `n`
  preemptively; this is the *only* time `(k, n)` moves without
  observed loss.

**FEC-knob selectors (within an escalation):**

- `burst_rate` → drives interleaver depth.
  `count_bursts_recovered` is RX's count of blocks where FEC
  recovered ≥ ⌈(n-k)/2⌉ primaries in one go — a direct "the
  channel just dumped a clump on us and FEC saved it" signal.
  Rising → link is getting bursty → raise depth to disperse
  further.
- `holdoff_rate` → deadline fires when the RX gave up waiting
  for fragments. Non-zero means the current `(hold_off_ms)`
  window is too tight for observed inter-arrival jitter, OR the
  link is losing so many fragments the block never completes.
  Rising under sustained depth means the controller should
  either lower depth (reduce hold-off) or raise `n` (more parity
  so fewer recoveries hit the wall).
- `late_rate` → fragments arriving after their deadline.
  Non-zero means the TX's hold-off model isn't matching RX's
  expectation (e.g. radio-driver injection delays).
  Informational; persistent non-zero means the hold-off window
  should grow.

**Sanity:**

- `packet_rate_w` → reject feed-forward decisions when
  `count_p_data < 20` in the window (quiet streams or bitrate
  drops where 10 Hz sampling is too sparse). `residual_loss`
  still fires regardless — a glitch is a glitch even on a sparse
  window.

**Identities the daemon can rely on:**

```
count_p_all  ≈  count_p_data + count_p_session + count_p_bad + count_p_dec_err
                (≈ rather than = because a SESSION duplicate of the
                 already-current session bumps count_p_session from
                 the pre-decrypt path, and some bad/dec_err paths
                 short-circuit before the classification counter
                 would have incremented.)

count_p_outgoing  =  primaries_native + count_p_fec_recovered
                     where primaries_native is not exposed directly.
count_p_data      =  primaries_native + parity_received

                     (parity_received >= 0).

count_p_outgoing + count_p_lost  ≈  primaries the TX emitted this window
                 (the TX-emitted primary count is what `residual_loss`
                  in §3 uses as its denominator.)

### Secondary — radio driver cross-check

The radio backend (`iw` / nl80211) can report RSSI / SNR / noise
floor and bitrate estimate directly. These cross-check what
`IPC_MSG RX_ANT` reports — useful for detecting wfb-ng stat
anomalies or a flaky radio. The controller does not use them as
inputs to the policy engine; `RX_ANT` is the authoritative source.

### Tertiary — encoder / flight telemetry

Bitrate actually achieved by the encoder, frame-drop counters,
encoder queue depth, external signals like battery voltage,
altitude, GS distance. Not required for the core loop; useful for
sophisticated policies (e.g. knowing the drone is far away biases
toward defensive FEC; a low battery biases toward lower bitrate to
save wifi TX power).

---

## 4. Policy engine

Two coupled loops run against the single video stream that
fec-enhancements Phase 1 produces:

1. **Leading loop — RSSI-driven feed-forward** (§4.1). Keeps the
   link margin healthy. Sets MCS, TX power, and encoder bitrate
   from the observed `rssi` via a per-airframe table. Purpose:
   prevent loss from ever starting. (`short_gi` stays pinned to
   `false` — long guard interval is more robust at FPV distances;
   not controlled.)
2. **Trailing loop — loss-driven protective** (§4.2). Fires the
   instant `residual_loss > 0`. Raises FEC `n`, fires IDR, and —
   if loss is sustained — drops the leading loop down a gear.
   Purpose: safety net for when the leading loop was slow or
   mis-calibrated.

The two loops are intentionally asymmetric. The leading loop
operates on a half-second time scale (SNR changes that fast);
the trailing loop operates on a per-window time scale (a single
100 ms window with any loss is already a glitch the pilot saw).

### §4.1 — Leading loop: RSSI → (TX power, MCS, bitrate)

The leading loop is two nested controllers, keyed by time
constant:

- **Inner, fast: TX-power closed loop.** Targets a fixed
  `rssi_target_dBm` (default −60 dBm). Every ~1 s, nudge TX
  power up/down so observed `rssi` approaches target. Heavy
  anti-oscillation guards — see below.
- **Outer, slower: MCS / bitrate selector.** Maps the observed
  `rssi` to a `(mcs, bitrate)` row. Runs on the §3 EWMA-smoothed
  `rssi`, with hysteresis.

The inner loop normalises the link so the outer loop sees a
stable RSSI under most conditions. Only when TX power saturates
at the regulatory cap (and observed `rssi` still drops) does the
outer loop move down a row — that's the channel actually fading
faster than we can compensate.

#### Inner loop — TX-power control

Closed-loop rule, evaluated every
`tx_power_cooldown_ms` (default 1000 ms):

```
delta_db = rssi_target_dBm - rssi        # negative when we're above target
if abs(delta_db) < rssi_deadband_db:
    continue                             # inside the dead-band; do nothing
tx_power_new = clamp(tx_power_current + delta_db,
                     tx_power_min_dBm, tx_power_max_dBm)
if tx_power_new == tx_power_current:
    continue                             # already saturated or rounded away
emit CMD_SET_RADIO(tx_power=tx_power_new)
```

**Anti-oscillation (load-bearing — the naive "rssi low → raise
power → rssi high → drop power" loop otherwise rings forever):**

- **Dead-band (`rssi_deadband_db`, default 3 dB).** Ignore
  observed RSSI within ±3 dB of target. RF noise makes ±1–2 dB
  window-to-window jitter normal; reacting to it would chase
  noise. The dead-band must exceed the RSSI measurement noise.
- **Cooldown (`tx_power_cooldown_ms`, default 1 s).** At most
  one power step per second, even if RSSI is far from target.
  The link takes a few windows to settle after a power change;
  reacting faster overshoots.
- **MCS-change freeze (`tx_power_freeze_after_mcs_ms`, default
  2 s).** When the outer loop changes MCS, hold TX power steady
  for 2 s. MCS negotiation and radio re-initialisation can
  produce transient RSSI artefacts; power-adjusting on those
  would put the two loops into a fight.
- **Bounded per-step correction (clamp delta to ±3 dB).** Even
  if `delta_db` reads 15 dB (sudden obstacle), the single step
  is ≤ 3 dB. If the fade is real, the next tick (1 s later) will
  pick up the remaining delta. This keeps the loop well-damped
  even when observations are noisy.
- **Gain asymmetry (optional, per-airframe).** Some operators
  prefer `gain_up > gain_down` — raise power eagerly, drop it
  conservatively — to minimise the risk of running under-powered
  during a fade. Exposed as `tx_power_gain_up_db`,
  `tx_power_gain_down_db` in §6; default both to 1.0 (symmetric).

TX power changes are **not** advertised to the encoder or the
trailing loop. They're a pure link-margin adjustment.

#### Outer loop — MCS / bitrate table

The operating-point table maps `rssi` (EWMA-smoothed min across
antennas, §3) to a target `(mcs, bitrate_Mbps)`. Per-card radio
profile loaded at startup from `conf/radios/<name>.yaml` in the
dynamic-link repo — see §6.1 for the file format and the
`m8812eu2` default.

**Design rules common to all profiles:**

- MCS is capped at 7 (1T1R SISO). MCS 8–15 (2T2R MIMO) are
  deliberately out of scope for this controller — the mechanism
  to drive them would need per-antenna path-loss tracking, which
  the current RX_ANT pipeline doesn't surface cleanly. Single
  stream is enough for FPV video bandwidth.
- Bitrate number at each row is ~40–50 % of the nominal LGI
  throughput for that (bandwidth, MCS), leaving headroom for FEC
  parity (`(k, n) = (8, 12)` baseline = 50 % overhead) plus
  telemetry + re-tx margin.
- Sensitivity + `rssi_margin_db` determines the row's lower
  bound: `row_rssi_min_dBm = sensitivity_dBm + rssi_margin_db`.

**Default (M8812EU2, HT20, long GI), at `rssi_margin_db = 8`:**

| Band (dBm)          | MCS | bitrate  | `k` (§4.2 band) |
|---------------------|-----|----------|------------------|
| `rssi >= -69`       | 7   | 26 Mbps  | 8                |
| `-72 <= rssi < -69` | 6   | 23 Mbps  | 8                |
| `-74 <= rssi < -72` | 5   | 21 Mbps  | 6                |
| `-77 <= rssi < -74` | 4   | 16 Mbps  | 6                |
| `-80 <= rssi < -77` | 3   | 10 Mbps  | 4                |
| `-83 <= rssi < -80` | 2   |  8 Mbps  | 4                |
| `-85 <= rssi < -83` | 1   |  5 Mbps  | 2                |
| `-88 <= rssi < -85` | 0   |  3 Mbps  | 2                |
| `rssi < -88`        | —   | —        | — (`budget_exhausted`, RTH) |

Boundaries are `sensitivity_dBm + rssi_margin_db` for each MCS.
Bitrates are `data_rate_Mbps_LGI * 0.40` (see profile).
Profile provenance (which rows came from the vendor datasheet
vs. interpolation) lives in the profile file's header comment,
not in this runtime table — operators are expected to
field-validate the whole map per airframe regardless.

`k` per row keeps block-fill time proportional to bitrate, so
FEC latency stays ≲ 5–10 ms at every MCS row instead of running
up to 32 ms at k=8 / 3 Mbps. See §4.2 "(k, n) ladder" for the
per-k `n`-escalation ladders the trailing loop uses within each
band.

**fps adjustment.** The values above are tuned for the 60 fps
latency cap (50 ms). At 90 fps (33 ms cap) the latency-budget
predictor (§4 "Latency budget enforcement") may auto-drop `k`
one band when the preferred value combined with depth > 1 would
exceed the tighter cap. This is the same refusal/auto-adjust
mechanism that governs depth — no new subsystem. Operators who
want a hard fps-specific override can ship an `m8812eu2_90fps`
profile with the adjusted `k` column baked in.

These are illustrative — actual MCS/sensitivity numbers are
chipset-specific. The per-airframe radio profile loaded at
startup (§6.1) overrides the defaults after field calibration.

**Row hysteresis.** 3 dB upper guard: to move *up* a row,
smoothed `rssi` must exceed the new row's lower bound by 3 dB
for at least 2 s. To move *down* a row: `rssi` below current
row's lower bound for 500 ms. Asymmetric — fast down, slow up.

**Why this composition is stable.** Inner loop's dead-band
(±3 dB around target) is larger than the outer loop's hysteresis
guard (3 dB), so inner-loop corrections never move the outer
loop on their own. The outer loop only trips when either (a) TX
power saturates at the regulatory max and the fade continues, or
(b) the fade exceeds `rssi_target ± 3 dB` for long enough that
the inner loop's 1 s cooldown hasn't caught up — in both cases
we want the MCS drop.

**Encoder bitrate derives from MCS row.** Conservative: ~50–60 %
of the nominal MCS throughput at `(k=8, n=12)` overhead, leaving
airtime for FEC parity + re-tx + telemetry.

**Commands emitted:**

- MCS → `CMD_SET_RADIO` to the drone's `wfb_tx` (with
  `short_gi = false` always — the applier pins it regardless of
  what the GS sends).
- TX power → radio backend (`iw` helper) on the drone.
- Encoder bitrate → encoder-backend helper on the drone
  (Phase 1 wiring; §7).

MCS and encoder bitrate travel in the same decision packet so
the applier either applies both or neither (atomicity matters —
an MCS drop without a matching bitrate drop queues airtime debt
that becomes loss). TX-power changes are independent and can fly
in their own decision packet.

### §4.2 — Trailing loop: loss-driven protective escalation

**Reaction is immediate, not hysteresis-delayed.** One 100 ms
window with `residual_loss > 0` means the pilot already saw a
glitch. The controller treats that as a ground-truth signal that
the leading loop was too optimistic, and responds on the same
tick:

| Trigger (this 100 ms window) | Actions (all on the same decision packet)                                                    |
|---|---|
| `residual_loss_w > 0`        | (a) raise FEC `n` one step **within the current `k`-band** (§4.2 ladder; e.g. at `k=8` the steps are `(8,12) → (8,14) → (8,16)`). If already at the top `n` of the band, drop into the next lower band at its floor (`(6, 12)` for `k=8`) — the "Step 3 drops k" transition.<br>(b) **request an IDR from the encoder** (GS → drone applier → encoder helper, §2): the current GOP is already corrupted by the lost primary, so the decoder needs a fresh keyframe to resync cleanly; waiting for the next scheduled IDR would extend the blocky patch.<br>Issued via `CMD_SET_FEC` with the new `(k, n)`. |
| `residual_loss_w > 0` *and* last two windows also had loss | All of the above, *plus* step the leading loop down one MCS row (force-drop via `CMD_SET_RADIO`, inner TX-power loop stays frozen for `tx_power_freeze_after_mcs_ms`). If the new row sits in a lower `k`-band, the trailing loop rebases at the new band's floor rather than stacking escalations. Repeat-loss means the leading loop's calibration is wrong, not just a one-off. |
| `fec_work` rising, `residual_loss_w == 0` | raise `n` one step within the current `k`-band, preemptively (waits for next `min_change_interval_ms_fec` boundary). No IDR — nothing has glitched yet. |

**IDR-request mechanics.** The request flows:

1. GS service detects `residual_loss_w > 0` → appends an
   `idr_request` flag to the outgoing decision packet on the
   same tick.
2. Drone applier receives the decision, applies FEC change via
   `CMD_SET_FEC`, and dispatches `idr_request` to the encoder
   helper over the local Unix socket (Phase 1 wiring;
   `/var/run/wfb-enc.sock`).
3. Encoder helper forces an IDR on the *next* encoded frame.

End-to-end latency from loss event to next IDR hitting the wire
is ~1 frame period (16.7 ms at 60 fps) plus the return-link RTT
(typically < 10 ms). Well inside the "pilot just saw one blocky
block" window — the next frame recovers.

**Cooldown bypass.** The trailing loop's `residual_loss_w > 0`
path **bypasses** `min_change_interval_ms_fec` (see §4 cooldown
rules). A glitch is a glitch; we pay the 12 ms 1C refresh cost
+ one frame of IDR bandwidth immediately rather than waiting
out the cooldown. IDR flood is prevented separately by the
drone applier's `min_idr_interval_ms` throttle (default 500 ms,
§6 drone config, §10).

**`(k, n)` ladder — per-MCS-row `k`, per-k `n` escalation.**
`k` is set by the radio profile row (§6.1) for the current MCS;
`n` escalates within that row in response to loss. Why split
this way:

- **`k` is driven by bitrate, not by loss.** Block-fill time is
  `k × MTU × 8 / bitrate`. At low bitrate, `k=8` fills so slowly
  that even depth 1 blows the FPV latency cap. A per-row `k`
  keeps block-fill proportional to frame period at every
  operating point.
- **`n` is driven by loss.** Within a given `k`, additional
  parity is the cheap-on-latency, expensive-on-airtime knob that
  responds to observed channel quality at that MCS row.

Four steps per `k`-band, same shape across all bands (floor →
+25% → +50% → drop `k`):

| k  | Floor       | Step 1      | Step 2      | Step 3 (drop k) |
|----|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 8  | `(8, 12)`   | `(8, 14)`   | `(8, 16)`   | `(6, 12)`       |
| 6  | `(6, 10)`   | `(6, 12)`   | `(6, 14)`   | `(4, 8)`        |
| 4  | `(4, 8)`    | `(4, 10)`   | `(4, 12)`   | `(2, 6)`        |
| 2  | `(2, 4)`    | `(2, 6)`    | `(2, 8)`    | `(1, 4)`        |

The `k=8` band matches master.cfg `[video]`'s existing floor of
`(k=8, n=12)` and is the steady-state at MCS 6–7.

**Why Step 3 drops `k` (not just raises `n` further).** Once
loss has escalated to the `n_max` row of a band and is still
non-zero, the channel is too lossy for parity expansion alone;
reducing `k` (i.e. the data-per-block ratio) buys finer-grained
recovery. Step 3 is the transition into the next-lower band —
typically the next MCS-row change follows it within seconds.

**Band boundary crossings.** When the leading loop changes MCS
row and the new row's preferred `k` differs from the current
`k`, the trailing loop issues a `CMD_SET_FEC` to rebase at the
new band's floor (or nearest equivalent protection level). Cost:
one 1C refresh (~12 ms stall + (D−1) blocks discarded). With
hysteresis on the leading loop, MCS-row changes are seconds
apart at worst, so band crossings are not a busy path.

**Interleaver depth ladder.** Ceilings per the FPV latency
budget in
[fec-enhancements-v2.md §4.2](fec-enhancements-v2.md#42-latency-budget):

| Floor | 60 fps ceiling | 90 fps ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | 2 |

Per fec-enhancements-v2.md §4.2 worked example, one depth step
at `(k=8, n=12)` adds ~12 ms; depth 3 total latency ~37 ms at
the reference operating point — matches the `(k=8, n=14) d=3 =
37 ms` row in §4.2's table, under the 50 ms cap.

**Within a protective escalation, which FEC knob moves?**

- `burst_rate` low (< 1 burst-recovery / s on the EWMA) → raise
  `n`. Losses are uniform; FEC parity budget is the right answer.
- `burst_rate` rising AND `holdoff_rate > 0` → raise depth.
  Losses clumping + RX missing deadlines = interleaver is sized
  too small.
- Both signals present → raise both one step.

**On step-down** (multiple consecutive windows with
`residual_loss_w == 0` *and* rising `rssi`), lower depth first
(reclaims the most latency), then lower `n`. Never lower depth
and `n` in the same tick. The leading loop drives its own
step-up (MCS/bitrate) independently via §4.1's hysteresis.

### Why the controller cadence can be fast (1C design)

Phase 1 Step C wired `refresh_session` under plan v2.1 R1 (option
1C): `session_key` is process-lifetime-constant;
`CMD_SET_FEC` / `CMD_SET_INTERLEAVE_DEPTH` reconfigure the codec in
place and re-broadcast SESSION on the same key. Each command:

1. Close the currently-open FEC block with FEC-only closers.
2. Flush the interleaver (partial D-frame discarded).
3. Reconfigure FEC + interleaver in place.
4. Broadcast a session-refresh TLV on the **same** `session_key`.

Refresh cost — **two components** (budgeted from
fec-enhancements-v2.md §4.2, not measured; Phase 1 bench only
covers encode/decode paths):

- **Stall** (no-data window on the TX): ≤ 1 block-duration (~12 ms
  at `(k=8, n=12)`). Independent of depth — just the time to close
  the currently-open FEC block.
- **Data loss**: up to `(D − 1)` blocks of in-flight payload
  discarded when the interleaver flushes, aged out by RX's Step D
  deadline sweep. Scales with depth — at D=3 that's up to ~24 ms
  of payload per refresh (~one frame at 60 fps).

On the RX: `session_key` is preserved, but the rx_ring is wiped
via `deinit_fec` when `(k, n)` changes. No decryption gap; the
in-flight blocks at refresh time are discarded consistent with the
TX-side loss budget above.

**Cooldowns — policy, not code-enforced.** The TX accepts
back-to-back refreshes at any interval the control socket can
serve; these floors are chosen by the daemon. 200 ms matches the
operator-observed minimum interval between real-flight
`(k, n, depth)` changes (obstacle transitions, range-driven bitrate
adjustments — see fec-enhancements-v2.md UNDECIDED-1 v2.1 decision).
Going below 200 ms gets expensive on the data-loss side: at D=3,
~24 ms of payload per refresh against a 200 ms interval is ~12 %
of the video stream potentially dropped at the cooldown floor.
Going above 1 s leaves the controller unable to react to
burst-behind-trees transitions. 200 ms is the pragmatic midpoint.

Rules (all daemon-side policy):

- Minimum **200 ms** cooldown between any two `CMD_SET_FEC` calls.
- Minimum **200 ms** cooldown between any two
  `CMD_SET_INTERLEAVE_DEPTH` calls.
- Minimum **50 ms** cooldown between a `CMD_SET_FEC` and a
  `CMD_SET_INTERLEAVE_DEPTH` targeting the same stream. Chosen to
  avoid stacking two refreshes into overlapping block-closer
  windows; the TX handles back-to-back refreshes correctly, so
  this is latency-of-a-single-refresh padding, not a correctness
  constraint.
- State-machine steps fire at most one knob change per tick
  (daemon policy; "never lower depth and `n` in the same tick" in
  the knob-selection rules below is enforced here, not by the TX).

### Latency budget enforcement

Every proposed decision goes through a predictor (see
[fec-enhancements-v2.md §4.2](fec-enhancements-v2.md#42-latency-budget)):

```
latency_total = block_fill_time + block_airtime + fec_decode_time
              + (depth − 1) × block_duration
```

The predictor runs before every proposed knob change. Two
outcomes:

1. **Proposed `(k, n, depth)` fits the budget** → decision goes
   through.
2. **Proposed combination exceeds the budget** → the predictor
   auto-adjusts *downward* in this priority order, re-predicting
   after each step:
   - Drop `depth` by 1 (reclaims `block_duration` of latency per
     step; cheap to unwind if the channel improves).
   - If depth is already 1 and the budget still doesn't fit,
     drop `k` to the next-lower band (per §4.2 ladder); `n` is
     rebased to the new band's floor or the nearest equivalent
     protection.
   - If no combination fits (even `(2, 4), d=1`), **refuse**.
     The controller holds the current state, logs
     `budget_exhausted`, and surfaces the condition to the GS
     operator (and optionally the flight controller).

This is where fps-dependence hits the decision flow: at 90 fps
`max_latency_ms` shrinks to ~33 ms, so the auto-adjust will step
through a lower-k band earlier in the escalation than it would
at 60 fps / 50 ms. Rationale: beyond the FPV latency budget the
link is unflyable regardless of how reliably the bytes arrive —
better to return home at the current level than add latency
that breaks control-feel.

### Full knob ordering — who moves when

The two loops partition the nine knobs from §1:

| Knob group        | Owner (loop)                    | Trigger                           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| MCS               | Leading (§4.1, outer loop)      | observed `rssi` crosses a row boundary (inner TX-power loop saturated or fade faster than cooldown) |
| Encoder bitrate   | Leading (§4.1, outer loop)      | Row change (coupled to MCS)       |
| Encoder fps       | Leading (§4.1), last-resort row | `rssi` < MCS-0 floor              |
| `(k, n)`          | Trailing (§4.2)                 | `residual_loss > 0` or `fec_work` rising |
| Interleaver depth | Trailing (§4.2)                 | `burst_rate` + `holdoff_rate`     |
| TX power          | Leading (§4.1, inner loop)      | closed-loop to `rssi_target_dBm` (dead-band + cooldown; see §4.1) |
| Encoder ROI       | Leading (§4.1), optional        | Only when bitrate pinned to floor |
| Emit IDR          | Trailing (§4.2)                 | Any `residual_loss_w > 0` window (rate-limited by `min_idr_interval_ms`) |

**FPV doctrine on degradation order.** When the leading loop
exhausts its table (even at MCS 0, RSSI still below floor),
degrade the encoder in this order before resorting to dropping
out:

1. Drop encoder **bitrate** further (already coupled to MCS, but
   a fixed floor per MCS row lets us squeeze more).
2. Drop encoder **fps** (90 → 60 → 30). Noticeable but flyable.
3. Apply **ROI / foveated encoding** (centre gets budget, edges
   starve). Only on hardware that supports it.
4. Drop **resolution**. Pilot-feels-very-wrong; last resort.

**Resolution never for normal degradation** — only on the
last-row failure path. The FPV preference is blocky video over
glitchy video, so the encoder becomes the knob that absorbs the
bandwidth crunch; FEC stays generous.

**IDR-on-command** fires on every `residual_loss_w > 0` window
(§4.2) so the decoder gets a fresh keyframe the moment protection
ramps up — the previous GOP is already corrupted by the lost
primary and continuing to diff off it only extends the visible
artefact. Rate-limited by `min_idr_interval_ms` (default 500 ms)
to keep a sustained loss event from flooding keyframes onto the
link. The leading loop does *not* request IDR on MCS / bitrate
changes by itself; MCS changes at matched bitrate drops don't
corrupt the GOP, so no keyframe is needed.

### §4B — Drone-local OSD output

The applier writes its current state to `/tmp/MSPOSD.msg`
(default; overridable in drone config) every
`osd_update_interval_ms` milliseconds (default 1000 ms).
[OpenIPC/msposd](https://github.com/OpenIPC/msposd) reads the
file and overlays the text on the outgoing video before it
reaches the encoder, so the pilot sees the current profile
through the same video feed they're flying.

**Line format (one line, fits in ~40 columns for typical OSD
fonts):**

```
LA MCS7 26M (8,12)d1 TX23 R-60
```

Fields, in order:

| Token              | Meaning                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `LA`               | Fixed prefix — "link-adapt"              |
| `MCS7`             | Current MCS index                        |
| `26M`              | Current encoder bitrate (Mbps, int)      |
| `(8,12)d1`         | Current `(k, n)` and interleaver depth   |
| `TX23`             | Current TX power (dBm, int)              |
| `R-60`             | Most recent smoothed `rssi` (dBm, int)   |

Events append a second line for one update cycle:

```
LA IDR  (n↑) loss@t=19.1s
LA MCS6→MCS5 k-rebase (6,10)
LA WATCHDOG safe_defaults
```

msposd renders both lines if present. Color codes (msposd's
custom-message convention) are applied to draw protective
escalations in red / amber. Colour mapping lives in the drone
config — operators who find the colours distracting can disable
per field.

The OSD sink is a file write at 1 Hz; overhead is negligible,
and `/tmp` being tmpfs on typical OpenIPC images means no disk
I/O. If the applier crashes, `/tmp/MSPOSD.msg` stops being
refreshed; msposd keeps showing the last message — note it's
stale, not live.

## 5. Safety model

Four specific failsafes. Failsafes 1 and 4 live inside the drone
C applier (non-negotiable, in-process, independent of the GS).
Failsafes 2 and 3 live inside the GS Python service (the decision
source). The split is deliberate: anything that protects the drone
from a sick GS must not depend on the GS.

1. **Watchdog on the GS link.** *(Drone applier, C.)* If no
   decision packet arrives for `health_timeout_ms` (default 10 s),
   the applier pushes `safe_defaults` once to the local `wfb_tx`
   control socket and stops touching the TX until a fresh decision
   arrives. The drone never gets stuck at an aggressive setting
   because the GS fell off the air.
2. **(Withdrawn)** *Oscillation detector.* The original failsafe 2
   counted distinct knob-value changes in a window and locked at
   the "safer" value for 60 s on overflow. Field bring-up showed
   the trigger fires on normal operation (RSSI walking through a
   wooded area is enough), and the lock then prevents recovery
   long after conditions improve. The leading loop's hysteresis
   (`rssi_up_hold_ms`, `rssi_down_hold_ms`) and the per-knob
   cooldowns (`min_change_interval_ms_*`) already cap genuine
   ping-ponging without freezing the link. Removed. If pathological
   oscillation surfaces in future flight testing, design a
   targeted detector (e.g., direction-reversal counter) rather
   than re-introducing this one.
3. **Never exceed the latency cap.** *(GS service, Python.)*
   Predicted-latency check per §4 above. Refuse, don't degrade
   latency.
4. **Safety ceiling enforced locally.** *(Drone applier, C.)*
   The applier independently rejects any command above the
   per-airframe ceiling from the drone's local config file, even
   if the GS signed off on it. Ceilings cover:
   - `(k, n, depth)` for FEC / interleaver.
   - `tx_power_max_dBm` — regulatory / hardware cap on TX power.
     Critical: a mis-calibrated GS asking for 33 dBm on a
     chipset rated for 20 dBm can damage the PA. The applier
     clamps every TX-power decision to the local ceiling.
   - `mcs_index` / `bandwidth` pairs the chipset is validated
     for.

   If the GS is compromised, the drone still flies inside its
   envelope. The interleaver-depth ceiling must also stay ≤
   `MAX_INTERLEAVE_DEPTH` (8, at
   [src/rx.hpp:103](../../src/rx.hpp#L103)) — the compile-time
   RX ring sizing. `wfb_tx_cmd` accepts `depth 1..255` and
   `wfb_tx` only rejects depth conflicts against `n > 32` /
   `fec_timeout > 0`; nothing in the TX rejects depth > 8, so
   the applier is the only line of defense for that bound.

### What a watchdog-triggered fallback looks like

```
safe_defaults = {
    video: (k=8, n=12),   # 50% overhead; matches master.cfg [video] floor
    depth: 1,             # depth 1 = no interleaving, lowest latency
}
```

Chosen so that the drone survives until a human (or the flight stack)
reacts.

---

## 6. Config surface

Two config files — one per component. The GS controller owns the
policy tuning; the drone applier owns the hardware ceiling. Where
they overlap (hard bounds), the drone-side values are authoritative.

### GS side — `/etc/dynamic-link/gs.yaml`

Standalone YAML file, owned by the dynamic-link GS service.
Not a wfb-ng config section — the service is a separate
process. YAML for consistency with the radio-profile files
(§6.1) and because the schema is nested (bounds + leading loop
+ trailing loop + safe_defaults).

**Wfb-ng prerequisite:** set `log_interval = 100` in the
`[common]` section of wfb-ng's
[master.cfg:26](../../wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg#L26) (default is
1000). The GS service needs the 10 Hz stats cadence described
in §3; wfb-ng-wide metric cadence is controlled by that single
knob. This is a wfb-ng config change, not a dynamic-link one —
the only wfb-ng-side change the operator has to make.

`enabled: false` is the default; no behavior change for
operators who don't opt in.

### §6.1 Radio card profiles — `conf/radios/*.yaml`

Different WiFi chipsets have different sensitivities, TX-power
budgets, and supported bandwidth modes. Rather than bake one
chipset's numbers into the design, the GS service loads a
**radio profile** at startup — one YAML file per card. YAML is
the right fit: pure data, no code execution, hand-editable,
comment-friendly for source attribution.

**Resolution order at startup:**

1. `<radio_profiles_dir>/<radio_profile>.yaml` — operator
   override, default `/etc/dynamic-link/radios/`.
2. `<package_install_dir>/conf/radios/<radio_profile>.yaml` —
   packaged default, shipped with the dynamic-link install.

The override path lets operators ship field-calibrated profiles
without editing the packaged files.

**Profile schema (default `m8812eu2.yaml`):**

```yaml

# MCS 1-6 values in this file are linear-in-dBm interpolation
# between those endpoints (2.71 dB per step, rounded to int).
# Field-validate every row per airframe before operational use

```

**Startup validation.** The GS service, on load:

- Parses the YAML with a safe loader (no Python-tag support).
- Confirms `mcs_max <= 7` (design policy).
- Confirms every `(bandwidth, mcs)` pair in the row range has
  both a `sensitivity_dBm` entry and a `data_rate_Mbps_LGI`
  entry.
- Confirms every MCS in `preferred_k` is in the `{2, 4, 6, 8}`
  set (the bands §4.2 defines) and that `preferred_k` values
  decrease monotonically from MCS 7 to MCS 0.
- Builds the runtime `rssi_mcs_map` from `sensitivity_dBm` +
  `rssi_margin_db` + `data_rate_Mbps_LGI * encoder_bitrate_frac`
  + `preferred_k`. The row table shown in §4.1 is the output of
  this build for the `m8812eu2` HT20 default.
- Runs the latency-budget predictor at the chosen `video_fps`
  against each row's preferred `k` at depth 1 and depth 2. If
  any row would exceed `max_latency_ms`, the service logs a
  warning and notes the auto-drop-k rows for runtime.

**Adding a new card.** Drop a new file under
`<radio_profiles_dir>/<name>.yaml` (operator-local) or
`conf/radios/<name>.yaml` (packaged), fill in the schema
above, set `leading_loop.radio_profile: <name>` in
`/etc/dynamic-link/gs.yaml`. No code changes. Source
attribution in the file header is required (the loader
doesn't enforce it but code review should).

### Drone side — `/etc/dynamic-link/drone.conf`

Read by the `dl-applier` C binary at startup. Syntax is a
minimal `key = value` format (no sections; keep the parser in
the applier tiny — no YAML dependency on the drone image).
Hardware ceilings and applier behaviour only; policy values
live on the GS.

# IDR throttle — authoritative cap on encoder IDR-request rate.

# (§4.2); the applier drops any IDR that arrives within
# min_idr_interval_ms of the last one it forwarded. Lower
# bound: ~1 frame period (16.7 ms @ 60 fps, 11.1 ms @ 90 fps).
# Higher values trade fewer keyframes for a longer corruption

## 7. Phased plan

Each phase independently shippable, behind the master off-switch.

### Phase 0 — Observer mode (GS Python only, log-only)

Goal: validate the controller's decisions against a pilot's
subjective link-quality judgement before any command is applied.

- **GS side (Python).** New standalone service (dynamic-link
  repo), subscribing to wfb-ng's JSON stats API on
  `stats_port` (see §3). No new `wfb_rx` spawn, no stdout
  parser needed — the JSON feed already carries the parsed
  PKT/SESSION/RX_ANT records.
- Computes the §3 signal set — `rssi` (smoothed), `residual_loss`
  (raw per window), `fec_work`, `burst_rate`, `holdoff_rate`,
  `late_rate` — and runs both control loops (§4.1 leading,
  §4.2 trailing).
- **Emits no commands.** Prints decisions to stdout / file (and
  optionally to the GS OSD, read-only) so operators can validate
  them.
- **Drone side: no change.** The C applier is not shipped yet.
- **Files added (net-new), GS side only:**
  - Under `gs/dynamic_link/` (Python package):
    - `service.py` — service entry point; subscribes to
      wfb-ng's JSON stats API (§3), drives the policy tick,
      emits decisions to a log/stdout sink (return-link
      transport wired in Phase 2).
    - `policy.py` — leading + trailing loops, knob selector.
    - `predictor.py` — latency predictor mirroring
      fec-enhancements-v2.md §4.2.
    - `profile.py` — radio-profile loader (§6.1); builds the
      runtime `rssi_mcs_map` from the selected profile.
    - `stats_client.py` — wfb-ng stats-JSON subscriber.
  - Under `conf/`:
    - `radios/m8812eu2.yaml` — default radio profile (§6.1).
    - `gs.yaml.sample` — sample GS config (§6).
  - Systemd unit `packaging/dynamic-link-gs.service` that
    starts the service as a separate daemon on the GS host.
- **Risk:** zero to the live link.
- **Verification:** run during a real flight; log output matches
  pilot's subjective "link quality" judgement.

### Phase 1 — Drone applier with all backends (drone-only)

Goal: ship a complete drone-side applier — all three backends,
both drone-side failsafes, OSD wiring — and verify it end-to-end
on the drone *without* any GS-side decision emission. Operators
drive the applier by hand from a local UDP tool so each backend
can be validated in isolation before the GS takes over.

No GS changes in this phase. Phase 0's GS observer keeps running
in log-only mode; wiring the observer's output to the return
link is deferred to Phase 2.

- **Drone side (C), net-new, under `drone/src/`:**
  - `dl_applier.c` — single-file applier binary. Links
    against libc and (optionally) libnl for the radio backend.
    Includes the **vendored** `tx_cmd.h` for the wire format
    to `wfb_tx`. No Python, no Twisted.
  - `dl_applier.h` — internal helpers + decision-packet
    struct definition (shared with the GS serialiser via a
    Python-side mirror module).
  - `dl_inject.c` — companion CLI that crafts a single
    decision packet and sends it to the applier's UDP listen
    port. Modelled on `wfb_tx_cmd`. Used for operator bringup
    and CI; **this is the decision source in Phase 1**, because
    the GS isn't sending anything yet.
  - `vendored/tx_cmd.h` — copy of wfb-ng's `src/tx_cmd.h`,
    pinned to a specific wfb-ng commit. Header comment
    records the source SHA and a startup check confirms
    `WFB_IPC_CONTRACT_VERSION` matches the running `wfb_tx`.
  - `vendored/README.md` — documents how to refresh the
    vendored header when wfb-ng bumps the contract.
  - `drone/Makefile` — targets `dl-applier` and `dl-inject`.
  - `conf/drone.conf.sample` — drone-side config sample
    (see §6).
  - Init-system integration: `packaging/dynamic-link-applier.service`
    (systemd) and `packaging/dynamic-link-applier.init` (OpenRC),
    spawned alongside wfb-ng's existing `wfb_tx` service.
- **Backends active in Phase 1 (all three):**
  - **FEC/depth** via `src/tx_cmd.h` UDP to local `wfb_tx` —
    `CMD_SET_FEC`, `CMD_SET_INTERLEAVE_DEPTH`.
  - **Radio** via `iw` helper (shelled out via `posix_spawn`)
    or libnl directly: TX power (critical for the §4.1 inner
    loop), MCS, bandwidth via `CMD_SET_RADIO`. `short_gi`
    pinned to `false` (§1).
  - **Encoder** via local Unix socket
    (`/var/run/wfb-enc.sock` by convention) to a per-encoder
    helper: bitrate, fps, GOP, IDR-request, ROI. Target
    encoders: **waybeam_venc** and **majestic** on OpenIPC —
    one helper binary per encoder, shared control API shape
    (§7 Phase 3 → now collapsed into Phase 1).
- **Failsafes 1 and 4 (drone-side) live.** Watchdog on the GS
  link (fires `safe_defaults` after `health_timeout_ms`) and
  per-airframe safety ceiling (rejects anything over the
  configured bounds — FEC, depth, MCS, TX power, bandwidth).
- **OSD status line** written to `/tmp/MSPOSD.msg` on every
  applied decision and every tick (§4B); msposd picks it up if
  installed.
- **IDR-request throttle** enforced (`min_idr_interval_ms`,
  §10); injections exceeding the cap are dropped.
- **Init-system integration.** A single `systemd` unit (or
  OpenRC, where used) spawns the applier alongside the
  existing `wfb_tx` service on the drone.
- **Verification in Phase 1:**
  - Use `dl-inject` to drive each backend manually through
    its operating range; confirm the applier applies, the
    ceiling rejects appropriately, the watchdog fires after a
    10 s silence, and msposd shows the correct profile line.
  - Run the OpenIPC encoder helpers against a real camera and
    confirm `set_bitrate` / `set_fps` / `set_roi` /
    `request_idr` take effect on the video stream.
  - No flight; bench test covers everything because nothing
    on the GS sends commands yet.
- **Rollback:** stop `dl-applier`. With no process running,
  the drone reverts to wfb-ng's static master.cfg defaults.

### Phase 2 — GS decision emission end-to-end

Goal: wire the Phase 0 GS controller up to the Phase 1 drone
applier. This is the "dynamic-link turns on" phase.

- **GS side (Python), net-new, under `gs/dynamic_link/`:**
  - `wire.py` — decision-packet serialiser matching
    `drone/src/dl_applier.h`'s struct. Wire format frozen by
    a contract test shared between both sides (byte-for-byte
    comparison of serialised sample packets).
  - `return_link.py` — raw-UDP writer into the local `tunnel`
    stream endpoint that wfb-ng already binds
    (`tunnel_local_port` from §6).
  - `oscillation.py` — GS failsafe 2.
  - (Existing `predictor.py` already gates failsafe 3.)
  - `mavlink_status.py` — MAVLink status-channel reader;
    parses `STATUSTEXT` / custom rejection messages from the
    drone applier on the upstream `mavlink` stream (§10).
  - Flip `enabled: true` in `/etc/dynamic-link/gs.yaml` to
    activate end-to-end.
- **Drone side (C):** no net-new code. The Phase 1 applier is
  already the receiver.
- **Rollback:** on the GS, `enabled: false` — the service
  reverts to Phase 0 log-only behaviour and the drone applier
  sees silence, triggers the watchdog, and lands on
  `safe_defaults`.
- **Verification:** controlled-degradation bench test first
  (attenuator on GS → drone path), then flight validation.

### Phase 3 — Airframe tuning and flight validation

- Per-airframe calibration of the GS `gs.yaml` and the drone
  `drone.conf` ceiling.
- Controlled-degradation flight test (attenuator sweep, distance
  sweep, urban interference).
- Oscillation detector tuning (GS-side parameter).
- Sign-off on safe_defaults per airframe (both sides: GS
  `safe_defaults`, drone `safe_k` / `safe_n` / `safe_depth`).

## 8. Example timeline — range fade and recovery

60 fps, `max_latency_ms = 50`, default M8812EU2 HT20 profile,
`rssi_target = -60 dBm`, `tx_power_max = 23 dBm`. Drone flies
out to range over ~30 s, path loss rises from 68 dB cruise to
96 dB at the edge, then returns. The leading loop (RSSI-driven)
runs continuously; the trailing loop (loss-driven) stays quiet
because the leading loop keeps loss at zero. The controller
samples at 10 Hz internally; only the ticks where a knob
actually changes are shown.

`rssi ≈ tx_power − path_loss` below (antenna-gain constants
absorbed into `path_loss`). MCS rows per the default
`rssi_mcs_map` in §4.1.

```

(Guard interval is long throughout — `short_gi` is pinned to
`false` per §1; not shown in the table.)

What this illustrates:

- **0–22 s**: inner loop absorbs rising path loss by raising TX
  power 3 dB at a time; observed `rssi` stays near `-60 dBm`
  target. MCS row never changes. This is the design path —
  outer loop never touches MCS when the inner loop has margin.
- **t=22 s**: `tx_power` saturates at 23 dBm. Any further path
  loss shows up as real RSSI drop.
- **t=31 s**: observed RSSI crosses the MCS 7 row boundary
  (-69). Outer loop drops to MCS 6; `k` stays at 8 because MCS 6
  is in the same `k`-band.
- **t=35 s**: RSSI crosses the MCS 5 boundary (-72). Outer loop
  drops to MCS 5 **and** the trailing loop crosses a `k`-band
  (8 → 6). One `CMD_SET_FEC` rebases to `(6, 10)`; ~12 ms stall.
- **t=54 s**: recovery crosses the same `k`-band boundary in
  reverse (k=6 → k=8), another `CMD_SET_FEC` rebase.
- **t=57–65 s**: inner loop drops TX power in 3 dB steps down to
  a low cruise level. Dead-band + 1 s cooldown keeps it from
  oscillating around the target.
- **No IDR was fired** at any point — the trailing loop stayed
  quiet because the leading loop kept `residual_loss` at zero.
  The two `k`-band rebases happened during no-loss windows, so
  no IDR request accompanied them (band crossings on the leading
  loop's step-down path do not corrupt the GOP — they're
  coordinated rate drops).

### Contrast: unexpected multipath at a tree line (trailing loop fires)

Same flight, but at t=19s the drone dips behind a line of trees
and the leading loop hasn't yet dropped to MCS4 — residual_loss
fires because the fade was faster than RSSI told us:

```

t=19.0s  -67    0                  MCS7 26Mbps          (8,12) d=1       cruise with margin

                                                                         Pilot saw a blocky patch, not a

                                                                         next block.

```

Two things to notice:

1. The trailing loop's reaction at t=19.1s is **single-window**,
   not hysteresis-delayed. One 100 ms window with loss → raise
   `n` + IDR immediately. That's the FPV doctrine: a glitch is
   a glitch, don't wait to confirm a second one.
2. The step-down in the trailing loop takes multiple seconds
   even though `residual_loss` cleared at t=19.3s. This is
   asymmetric on purpose — we bought the protection cheaply, we
   pay it back slowly to avoid oscillation.

### `budget_exhausted`

If the leading loop hits MCS 0 with `rssi` still below the floor
(~-80 dBm), it raises `budget_exhausted` instead of dropping
further. The GS emits the signal to the flight controller (e.g.
MAVLink STATUSTEXT) and lets the flight stack decide (RTH /
hold altitude / pilot takes manual action). Under the FPV
doctrine, flying at MCS 0 with loss is not an option — blocky
video at MCS 1 is the floor for "still flyable."

## 9. Risks

1. **Oscillation** *(GS)*. Asymmetric hysteresis + cooldown +
   detector are the three-layer defense for the trailing loop
   and the outer MCS selector. Still requires tuning per
   airframe.
1a. **Band-boundary flapping** *(GS, coupled loops)*. A borderline
   RSSI right at a `k`-band boundary (e.g. between MCS 5 and MCS 6
   in the default profile) can cause repeated `k` rebases as the
   leading loop flips rows. Defence: the leading loop's existing
   row hysteresis (3 dB / 2 s up, 500 ms down) applies; the
   oscillation detector (failsafe §5 #2) will lock the row if
   it does thrash. Worth calibrating
   `rssi_mcs_map` row boundaries so they don't sit exactly at a
   `k`-band transition for the expected operating points.
1b. **TX-power oscillation** *(GS, inner loop)*. The naive
   "rssi low → raise power → rssi high → drop power → rssi low
   …" loop oscillates forever. Defence stack in §4.1: dead-band
   (3 dB), cooldown (1 s), MCS-change freeze (2 s), bounded
   single-step correction (3 dB). If the `rssi_deadband_db` is
   set below the observed RSSI measurement noise, the loop will
   ring — calibrate dead-band > measurement noise for the target
   chipset.
2. **Rekey storm** *(GS → drone)*. A sick stream at the cooldown
   edge could emit a command every 200 ms indefinitely.
   GS-side oscillation detector catches before the drone applier
   does.
3. **Stale decision telemetry** *(return link)*. Decision packets
   travel over the `tunnel` stream, which may itself be failing.
   Budget one-way decision-packet age at ≤ 2 s normally; >
   `health_timeout_ms` (10 s) → the drone applier falls back to
   safe_defaults (failsafe 1).
4. **Misclassification of burstiness** *(GS)*.
   `count_bursts_recovered` is a proxy: RX's count of blocks where
   FEC recovered ≥ ⌈(n-k)/2⌉ primaries. It tags a clumped-loss
   event but cannot distinguish "one bursty instant inside an
   otherwise calm window" from "sustained bursty channel." Reject
   windows with < 100 packets; consider a secondary EWMA over
   several windows before escalating depth.
5. **Backend failure modes** *(drone applier)*. Each backend
   (radio, encoder) can fail independently. The applier must
   tolerate "backend reports error" without crashing; it degrades
   to `wfb_tx`-only control and reports the degradation to the
   GS via MAVLink (§10 status channel).
6. **Drone applier / GS controller disagreement** *(both)*. The
   applier rejects commands outside its local ceiling. The GS
   controller sees the reject via MAVLink and must not re-issue
   immediately — rate-limit retries.
7. **GS starvation** *(GS)*. If the Python service gets starved
   (CPU overload, disk I/O on stdout parse), decisions lag. Run
   with soft real-time priority; avoid disk I/O on the hot path;
   keep log writes off the decision thread.
8. **Drone applier starvation** *(drone)*. Unlikely given the
   applier's small footprint, but worth noting: the applier is
   the only line of defence between the GS and the `wfb_tx`
   control socket. Run it at a priority at least matching
   `wfb_tx`.

## 10. Settled decisions

Design choices made after review; captured here so the rationale
for each stays with the doc.

- **Code location.** Dynamic-link is a separate repository
  from wfb-ng, named `dynamic-link`. Layout:
  ```
  dynamic-link/
    gs/
      dynamic_link/          # Python package
        service.py
        policy.py
        predictor.py
        profile.py
        stats_client.py      # wfb-ng JSON stats subscriber
        wire.py              # decision-packet serialiser (Phase 2)
        return_link.py       # raw-UDP writer (Phase 2)
        oscillation.py       # failsafe 2 (Phase 2)
        mavlink_status.py    # MAVLink status reader (Phase 2)

        dl_applier.h
        dl_inject.c
        vendored/
          tx_cmd.h           # pinned copy of wfb-ng src/tx_cmd.h
          README.md          # source SHA + refresh procedure
      Makefile
    conf/
      radios/                # m8812eu2.yaml and friends
      gs.yaml.sample
      drone.conf.sample
    packaging/
      dynamic-link-gs.service       # systemd
      dynamic-link-applier.service  # systemd
      dynamic-link-applier.init     # OpenRC
    doc/
      design/dynamic-link.md
  ```
  No wfb-ng source changes required to start — the
  integration surfaces (stats JSON API, `tx_cmd.h` wire
  format, tunnel/mavlink streams) are all pre-existing
  wfb-ng public surfaces on `feat/interleaving_uep`.

- **Return-link (GS → drone) protocol: raw UDP over `tunnel`.**
  Fixed-size decision-packet struct with explicit endianness.
  Rationale: keeps the drone-side C parser trivially small
  (single `struct`, `ntohl`/`ntohs`, no library dependency).
  Using MAVLink here would drag a MAVLink parser into the drone
  image for no win — decision packets don't need to coexist
  with flight-controller telemetry in the same parser.

- **Status channel (drone → GS): MAVLink.** The drone applier
  reports rejections (ceiling hits), watchdog fallbacks, and
  backend failures (risks §9 #5, #6) as MAVLink messages on the
  existing `mavlink` stream (`[drone]`/`[gs]` config at
  [wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg:132-154](../../wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg#L132-L154)).
  `STATUSTEXT` for human-readable events; a lightweight custom
  message type for structured rejections. The asymmetry (raw
  UDP down, MAVLink up) is deliberate: decisions need a tiny
  parser on a resource-tight drone; status upstream naturally
  co-locates with the flight-controller telemetry the GS
  operator already reads.

- **ROI encoding support.** Supported. The OpenIPC drone
  ecosystem has two video encoders in common use —
  **waybeam_venc** and **majestic** — and both expose roughly
  the same API shape (a JSON/ctl socket for bitrate / GOP / IDR
  and a ROI rectangle + QP-delta endpoint). The Phase 1 encoder
  backend (§7) targets this shared surface with a single helper
  per encoder; ROI is wired from day one rather than gated on
  a survey.

- **IDR-on-command throttle.** Minimum interval default **500 ms**,
  enforced by the drone applier (authoritative cap). The GS
  emits IDR requests freely whenever the trailing loop fires
  (§4.2); the applier drops any request that arrives within
  `min_idr_interval_ms` of the last one it forwarded to the
  encoder. Configurable per-airframe via
  `/etc/dynamic-link/drone.conf` — see §6 drone config.
  Rationale:
  the applier is the right enforcement point because it's the
  last stage before the encoder helper and it's the layer
  that's independent of GS correctness.

- **Drone-local OSD: msposd custom-message file drop.** The
  applier writes the current profile state to
  `/tmp/MSPOSD.msg` at 1 Hz;
  [OpenIPC/msposd](https://github.com/OpenIPC/msposd) reads
  the file and overlays the text on the video before encoding.
  See §4B for the line format. Chosen over a MAVLink-based
  OSD integration because msposd's file interface needs no
  protocol parser on either side and co-exists cleanly with
  the MAVLink upstream status channel — the two paths don't
  share machinery and can't interfere with each other.

## 11. Dependencies on wfb-ng

All pre-reqs ship on wfb-ng branch `feat/interleaving_uep`. No
wfb-ng source changes are required for dynamic-link to run.

- **Fec-enhancements Phase 1** (interleaver +
  `CMD_SET_INTERLEAVE_DEPTH` + 1C refresh semantics + 14-field
  `PKT` + 6-field `SESSION`). Commits `e71b317` through
  `d08a94e` on `feat/interleaving_uep`. Enables depth as a
  runtime knob, tight rekey cooldowns (§4), and the
  counter-derived metrics (§3).

- **`tx_cmd.h` wire format** (`src/tx_cmd.h`) —
  `CMD_SET_FEC`, `CMD_SET_INTERLEAVE_DEPTH`, `CMD_SET_RADIO`,
  and their struct layouts. Dynamic-link vendors a copy of
  this header pinned at a wfb-ng commit (drone side §10).
  Startup check: `WFB_IPC_CONTRACT_VERSION` from the vendored
  header must match what the running `wfb_tx` reports.

- **JSON stats API** on `stats_port` (default 8103 on GS host;
  see wfb-ng [master.cfg:138](../../wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg#L138)).
  Dynamic-link's GS service subscribes to this feed (§3).
  Same schema wfb-cli consumes.

- **Tunnel and mavlink stream endpoints** (existing wfb-ng
  streams at
  [master.cfg:132-154](../../wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg#L132-L154)).
  Tunnel carries decision packets GS → drone (§10 settled
  return-link protocol); mavlink carries status packets
  drone → GS.

- **Stable `IPC_MSG` contract** underlies the JSON stats API
  (Phase 1 Step A; `WFB_IPC_CONTRACT_VERSION = 2`). **Gap:**
  the stability commitment lives at the plan-doc level only;
  no code test pins the field order. A contract test in
  wfb-ng (e.g. `tests/ipc_contract_test.py`) that freezes the
  14-field PKT / 6-field SESSION layouts would be a cheap
  upstream follow-up and protect dynamic-link from a future
  silent reorder in `wfb_rx`. Not a blocker — the JSON API
  schema is version-checkable at runtime via the
  `contract_version` field.

### Operational prerequisite (wfb-ng config change)

One wfb-ng config change is needed on the GS host to enable
dynamic-link's 10 Hz cadence: set `log_interval = 100` in
`[common]` of `master.cfg` (see
[wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg:26](../../wfb_ng/conf/master.cfg#L26)).
Default is 1000. This is the only wfb-ng-side setting dynamic-
link requires; everything else is dynamic-link's own config.
